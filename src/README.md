To run Lumiere, BEAST 2 must first be recompiled with the source code contained in this directory. Please visit http://www.beast2.org/package-development-guide/ for instructions on how to recompile BEAST 2 from package source code.

We will hopefully release an updated version of Lumiere that can be added through the BEAST 2 Package Manager in the near future.

Please note that to run Lumiere in BEAST 2, the following additional add-on packages need to be installed:
-MASTER: https://github.com/tgvaughan/MASTER
-MultiTypeTree: https://github.com/tgvaughan/MultiTypeTree
